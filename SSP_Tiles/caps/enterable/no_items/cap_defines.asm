;Forbid things to be carried into pipes (only applies to pipe caps in the "setting0" folder):
 !Setting_SSP_CarryAllowed	= 1
  ;^0 = can't carry sprites through pipes, 1 = enable carrying.

 !Setting_SSP_YoshiAllowed	= 1
  ;^0 = yoshi cannot enter, 1 = can. NOTE: Small pipes always prohibits Yoshi regardless of this setting. Another note that unlike FuSoYa
  ; that makes the "spat" SFX, this plays SFX ONLY if you are tapping the 1-frame controller to prevent repeatedly playing the SFX and overwriting
  ; the channel and replacing SFX.
