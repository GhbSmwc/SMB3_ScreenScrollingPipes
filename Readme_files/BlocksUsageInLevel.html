<h1><center>Block pipe placements</center></h1>
<ul>

<li>Custom block pipe parts:
<table><tr><td><img src="PipeParts.png"></td></tr></table>
<table><tr><td><img src="PipeParts1.png"></td></tr></table>


</li><br>

<li>Pipe directions:<br>

<table><tr><td><img src="Map16_pipeDirections.png"><br></td></tr></table>
Keep in mind that the pipe stems and turn corners (they yellow 32x32 and 16x16 for small pipes) <b>aren't 1-way themselves</b>, the only blocks
that makes them 1-way are the pipe caps being &ldquo;exit only&rdquo;. Therefore, there are duplicate map16 blocks to make it easier to recognize
what the blocks do.</li><br>

<li>Things you should avoid placing and what you can do:</li>
<ul>
<li>I don't recommend using the pipes on layer 2, as the position can glitch around.</li><br>
<li>While using the pipes on layer 1 in a layer 2 level, be careful not to place solid blocks above the space in front of the small pipe caps, as
they would teleport/clip the player through the floor:
<table><tr><td><img src="DontPlaceLikeThis.png"></td></tr></table></li><br>

<li>3-way (T-shaped) intersections using turn pipe corners are possible. If the player enters the (normal) turn corners from the
&ldquo;outer&rdquo; edges that are not directly connected, the player will maintain his current direction:<br>
<table><tr><td><img src="3WayIntersectionWithNormalCorners.png"></td></tr></table></li><br>

<li>With the new update with special turn corner parts, you can have different connections based on where the player enters them on the same turn corner
(A&rarr;B, B&rarr;C, C&rarr;D, D&rarr;A):<br>
<table><tr><td><img src="SpecialTurnCornersDemonstration.png"></td></tr></table></li><br>

How about A&harr;B, C&harr;D? (note that I use &harr; and not &rarr; to indicate a 2-way between points). Now you can have 2 &ldquo;opposite&rdquo; corners
on the same area.
<table><tr><td><img src="SpecialTurnCornersDemonstration1.png"></td></tr></table></li><br>

Just remember that if the player hits any <tt>turn_special_prep_&lt;direction&gt;.asm</tt>, they will set the <i>prep-direction</i> that
Mario will turn to that direction when he hits a special turn corner (<tt>turn_special_L.asm</tt>, <tt>turn_special_R.asm</tt>, and <tt>turn_special_small.asm</tt>).
This allows &ldquo;roundabout&rdquo; and &ldquo;U-turn&rdquo;-type intersections and much more.<br><br>

<li>You may be wondering, why did I have both types of corners if I can just have special turn corners? Well, here is my answer: Regular turn corners
don't require any prep-turns. With this, you can have two regular turn corners touching each other without the need to have a turn setup in between,
allowing compact pipe placements. Special turn corners, on the other hand, always have to have a setup direction if the next special turn corner needs
a different direction. Things to note about the corners:<br><br>

<ul>
<li>ALL turn corners, regular and special, themselves do not change the prep-direction, instead, it will keep its direction until
<tt>turn_special_prep_&lt;direction&gt;.asm</tt> have been triggered again, thus you can do something like this where the second
and later in the sequence special turn corners no longer need a prep-turn:

<table><tr><td><img src="MaintainedTurnCorners.png"></td></tr></table>
Note the red circles means that no turn-preps.<br><br>

And even when you wanted parallel pipes that switch places without having them to re-straighten them out (this is a 2-way pipe demonstration, if 1-way, you
only need 1 connector in between the parallel pipes), you can do this in a more compact way:

<table><tr><td><img src="ParallelPipeSwap.png"></td></tr></table></li>

</ul></li>
</li>


</ul>

</ul>
