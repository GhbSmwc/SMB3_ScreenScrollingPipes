;These are tables containing the warps (each warp is 1 entry, therefore 2-way takes 1 entry from point A to B
;and another from point B back to point A).
;
;When I mean “entry”, I mean the number of items, regardless of the value is 8 or 16-bit.
;
;Due to signed 16-bit limitations, you can have up to 32768 ($8000 in hex, index numbers from $0000-$7FFF
;(0-32767)) warp entries in your entire game per this routine. Highly unlikely you would even get close to
;that number.
;
;Also note that if you have a huge number of entries here, and you trigger this routine that does not match
;any of the entries here (match the direction to warp, level number, and XY start position), the game will lag.
;Reason of the lag is because this code checks every single entry in these tables and all of them will fail.
;
;Technically, this should only lag for 1-frame execution (barely noticeable though) when it matches, especially
;if the player triggering the warp mode block matches with the first entry on the list (the loop code above
;starts at the last index and counts backwards until a match is found or when reaches a negative number).
;
;If you need a lot of warp entries and not have slowdown, here are ways to avoid it:
;-Avoid making it possible for the player to trigger the [Dragplayer.asm] in the wrong direction, it will do
; nothing by default as intended, but it still have to check a list of correct directions.
;--For 2-way warps, don't place the warp destinations (or EndPositionX and Y) that would place the player
;  touching the drag player block he's touching as he leaves that spot. Place him a tile away (such as
;  above it in an upwards facing pipe).
;-Divide the table into separate subroutines, and have it separate per version. Meaning have duplicates of
; this routine and the block with name variations, including the function call [%SSPDragMarioMode()] itself
; inside [DragPlayer.asm], with each of them having a smaller list. This will cut down the loop iterations
; and limits to what group it should focus on.
;--Example: Instead of having 100 items in the list, I would have:
;---2 drag mario subroutine files, the original and [SSPDragMarioMode1.asm] (note the “1” appended to the file name before the extension)
;---2 blocks to enter drag mode, the original and [DragPlayer1.asm] (duplicates should have [%SSPDragMarioMode1()])
;---And have 50 in each of the subroutine files.
;
;Remember, each nth item in the table is associated with another item from one another table also the nth item starting from the top, meaning
;that the first item (topmost, index 0) means all the first items in each table, the second is second for all other tables and so on.
;
;I recommend using comments, and labeling each item in the table with their index number so that you can track, and debug if anything goes wrong.
;You can automate this by making use of Notepad++ ( https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/ )'s column select (alt + shift + click elsewhere),
;then on the menubar:
;Edit -> Column Editor, on that window, have [number to insert] be checked, and:
;Inital number: 0
;Increase by: 1 or 2 (1 for db table, 2 for dw table)
;Format: Hex or Dec.
	;These determine which warp the player will take:
		;Direction to enter warp mode (traveling in other directions into
		;the warp will do nothing). Only use values $01-$04:
		;-$01 = Up
		;-$02 = Right
		;-$03 = Down
		;-$04 = Left
			?CorrectDirection
				;Keep all your numbers in between the label [?CorrectDirection] and [?.End]. This is needed to determine

	;These are the destination positions, in pixels (why not block positions, then LSR #4?,
	;well, because it is possible that the player must be centered horizontally between 2 blocks
	;than 16x16 grid-aligned as in the case with traveling through normal-sized vertical pipes).
	;
	;You can easily convert them into pixel coordinate via this formula:
	;	dw (BlockPos*$10)+HalfBlock
	;	
	;	-BlockPos = the X or Y position, in units of 16x16 (the coordinates of the block seen in Lunar Magic).
	;	-HalfBlock = $00 (16x16 aligned) or $08 (half-block aligned, with vertical normal-sized pipes, you
	;	 normally do this for X position though).

	;These positions are “feet” position of the player, rather than the head position.
	;When riding on yoshi, it is the position of Yoshi's saddle part, not the player's feet.
	;Therefore, to get the correct position in a pipe:
	;
	;-For Small horizontal pipes, it is the tile of the stem part, nuff said, same goes with vertical small pipe.
	;-For regular sized horizontal pipes, it is the bottom half of the stem.
	;-For regular sized vertical pipes, it is the bottom-left tile of the 2x2 16x16 block space the player is at least
	; touching, assuming you are using the [(BlockPos*$10)+HalfBlock] formula.
