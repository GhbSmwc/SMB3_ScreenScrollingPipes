-[done!] Prevent stunned sprites from being able to "unstun" themselves when the player is carrying them through pipes. Planned strategy: disable decrementation
 (regardless if the freeze setting of the defines is on or off) of their stun timers when pipe-carried. Add a whitelist for some sprites for compatibility
 with kaizo hacks involving carrying a throw block to enable it to vanish inside pipes.
-[done!] Have "passable" pipe tiles that act as decorations in the background (not as layer 2, placed in the backdrop of layer 1) that are used for
 pipe traveling. This also should completely disable carried sprite from interacting with other sprites outside the pipe.
-Because most hacks uses SSP to separate sections of the level (like a subroom), I am planning to add a loading trigger for SSP that will
 erase sprites and spawn them at a given location (such as the room the player is going to).
-[done!] Fix the turn block bridge that can block pipe movements.
-Make carried sprites into pipes also turn invisible with the player.
 Breakpoints to look out for:
 - 019CF3 (SubSprGfx0Entry0)
 - 019CF5 (SubSprGfx0Entry1)
 - 019F09 (SubSprGfx2Entry0)
 - 019F0D (SubSprGfx2Entry1)
 Sprite list is located at $0185CC (SpriteMainPtr)
 Actually, should look for “Stun<sprite_name>” around 01A12F (labeled “StunGoomba”).
